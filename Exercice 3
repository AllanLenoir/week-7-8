#Exercice 3
#Code : 

squares = []
x = 0
count = 1
squares = 1
while count <= 9:
    count += 1
    squares = count**2
    print(squares)

#At first I had this one but it was not in a list so the next day I decide to change it into:
#Code :
squares = []
x = 0
while x <= 10:
    squares.append(x**2)
    x = x + 1
print(squares)
