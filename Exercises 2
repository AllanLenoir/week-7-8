#Exercises 2
#Code : a = [ 66.25, 333, 333, 1, 1234.5 ]
print(a)
#the list is printed
a.insert(2, -1)
print(a)
#at the second place of the list we insert '-1'
a.append(333)
print(a)
#we had 333 at the last position
a.index(333)
print(a)
#nothing happened because if we want to print the index we should write “print(a.index(333))”
a.remove(333)
print(a)
#the first'333' is deleted
a.reverse() 
print(a)
#the list is reverse
a.sort()
print(a)
#the list is sorted from the smallest to the biggest
