#Exercice 6
#Code : 
#Write a program that will ask the user to enter two short sentences
list_sent = []
print("Enter two short sentences please")
sent1 = input("Enter the first sentence : ")
sent2 = input("Enter the second sentence : ")
#print(sent1 + " " + sent2)
#Concatenate the two sentences into one long sentence 

list_sent.append(sent1 + " " + sent2)
print(list_sent)

#Split the sentence into a list of words
split = sent1.split() + sent2.split()
print(split)
#Sort the words in alphabetical order and print them out
split.sort()
print(split)
#Print the total number of words contained in your list
print(len(split))
#Create a dictionary that will store each word together with the
#count of the occurrence of each word in your sentence.
#Print each item from the dictionary

Dict = {sent1, sent2}
for a,word in enumerate(split):
    print ("Word[%d]: %s" % (a,word))
